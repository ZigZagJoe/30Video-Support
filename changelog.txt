### 30Video HC v1.0.0.2122 REL

Initial release of firmware for the HC (high-color) cards. 
These support 16 bit color depth in hardware and have a LCD interface.

### 30Video SI/GS v1.0.0.2100 / 2101 RC

Release-Candidate containing the following changes:

	Fix Macsbug not returning cleanly
	Introduce Virtual desktop (512x684) mode for grayscale under Mac OS
	Bugfixes for virtual desktop on machines with two video cards :)
	Load video timings from ROM.
	Fix for running 2 30video cards in same system.
	Store current resolution seperately in grayscale mode 
	Add nonstandard 1024x768 (XGA) resolution @ 54hz (functionality not guarenteed with all monitors)
	Introduce backend support for hardware supporting 16 bit color
	Fixed virtual desktop behavior in 24 bit mode (over previous RC)
	
If all goes well with testing this will become the new shipping ROM version.

### 30Video SI/GS v1.0.0.2098 / 2099 Beta

Same as RC build 2100 (see above) with software 16 bit color support enabled.
Preview of functionality: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G5gZ5Tkv4s

NOTE! This mode is not really suited for normal use. The following limitations apply:

*  16bpp depth is software supported: It is expected to be much slower than other video modes. 
*  Screen refresh rate is a rolling 1hz except for mouse pointer. 
*  Only 640x480 is supported, and on external display only
*  There is a continuous CPU load at all times while in 16bpp mode. 
*  16bpp mode is only possible under Mac OS, will not work under A/UX.

For these reasons this is essentially a tech-demo and is unlikely to be rolled into release firmware, but it is here for experimentation. Bugs may be present.

### 30Video 1941-beta-XGA

Adds a nonstandard XGA resolution @54hz. Works on 4 of my monitors, but functionality is not guarenteed.

### 30Video_SI_Update_v1.0.0.1926-rel.bin

First version for SI card. Includes changes from GS card, except where those functions concern grayscale functionality.

### 30Video_GS_Update_v1.0.0.1917-beta

Fix mode changes while scrolled in virtual desktop mode
Store current resolution seperately in grayscale mode so it doesn't get wiped when changing to external and back again.

### 30Video_GS_Update_v1.0.0.1911-beta

Fix versioning.
Fix Macsbug not returning cleanly
Introduce Virtual desktop (512x684) mode for grayscale under Mac OS (disabled for A/UX)
Load timings from ROM.
Safety fix for running 2 30video in same system.

### 30Video_GS_Update_v1.0.1724-rel

Shipping firmware.
